        <h2>A recipe for a famous Polish soup: Zurek (Rye Soup)</h2>
        <p>Zurek is one of the most famous Polish soups. It's very filling and easy to prepare.
            It's often prepared for easter and Polish Christmas Eve.

        <h2>Ingridients:</h2><ul>
            <li>zakwas,</li>
            <li>Polish sasuage - kielbasa,</li>
            <li>1 onion,</li>
            <li>bacon,</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
            <li>2 large eggs,</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><ol>Steps:</h2>
            <li>Cook the white sausage: Heat the broth, when hot add the raw white sausages and simmer over very low heat for 15-20 minutes (if you have already cooked sausage omit this step and just slice them like in step 2).</li>
            <li>Chop all the meats: Take the sausages out of the broth and cut them into slices. Cut the smoked sausage into 1/2-inch (1 cm) cubes and bacon into small cubes. Dice the onion, press the garlic through a garlic press, peel the potatoes, and cut them into 1-inch (2.5cm) chunks.</il>
            <li>Brown all the meats: heat the oil in a large frying pan. When hot, add all the chopped meat and sausages. Cook over high heat for a couple of minutes until nicely browned. Add all the meats to the pot with broth.</li>
            <li>Cook the onions, garlic, and marjoram: Add the onions to the pan and cook over medium heat for a couple of minutes or until soft and translucent. Add the garlic and 1 tablespoon of marjoram and cook for 30-60 seconds more, until fragrant. Transfer the onions to the pot. Add a couple of tablespoons of broth to the pan and scrape with a spatula all the brown bits from the bottom of the pan (that’s where all the flavor is!), add them to the pot.
            </li>
            <li>Cook the potatoes: Add the potatoes to the pot. Bring the soup to a boil and cook over low heat for about 15 minutes or until the potatoes are soft.</li>
            <li>Add the sour rye starter. Stir the flour with the liquid and add to the soup (spices should be discarded). Make sure to add the starter gradually – trying the soup while you adding it, to make sure it’s not too sour for you (I always add the whole batch of my sour rye starter). Bring to a boil and simmer for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the cream to the soup. Add the horseradish to your taste (I only added 1/2 of a teaspoon) – be careful when adding horseradish, it’s powerful and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Season the soup with salt, pepper, and reserved 1 teaspoon of marjoram – rub the marjoram between your palms to release its aroma.
            Serve the soup with boiled eggs. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
