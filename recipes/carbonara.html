        <h2>Ingridients:</h2><ul>
            <li>1 pound spaghetti,</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil,</li>
            <li>8 slices of bacon,</li>
            <li>1 onion,</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
            <li>4 large eggs,</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of granted Parmesan cheese,</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><ol>Steps:</h2>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Place diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels, reserving 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet.</il>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. Add chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook 1 minute more.</li>
            <li>Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add cooked spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and toss again. Season with salt and pepper (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty).</li>
            <li>Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan cheese at the table.</li>
        </ol>
